# Bakeneko-65-with-Weight
Kkatanos Bakeneko 65 but with a Backpiece/Weight. The overall case was raised 1mm, but the undersite of the Blocker is not Raised.

Classic Kkatano, but with a weight. I might add technical drawings later, but currently you need to make them yourself. 
Thank you Kkatano for the Original Bakeneko 65 and 60: https://github.com/kkatano
